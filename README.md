# IranNewspapers
Scrape and ocr Iranian newspapers (Kayhan, Etellaat, and Jomhouri-ye Islami)

This is mean to run on a local environment, but should be adapted for cloud use due to the extensive time required to OCR a single month of a newspaper (approx 45 minutes for Etellaat, 20 minutes for Kayhan and Jomhouri-ye Islami)
